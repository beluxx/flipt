ğŸ‘‹ Welcome to developing Flipt in codespaces!

ğŸ‘¢ Your environment is all set up and bootstrapped.

ğŸš€ To get started, build a local version with the VS code task (â‡§âŒ˜B) or run
   the Server/Client run command to start the server and UI.
   After a minute or two the UI should be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8081/
